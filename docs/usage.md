## evals.json

Every skill ships one dataset at `<skill>/evals/evals.json`. A prompt alone
grades routing; add expectations and it also runs end to end. How to write one
is in [authoring-evals.md](authoring-evals.md).

## Configuring the repo under test

There is no config file. Everything about your repo is a CLI flag, or the same
thing as a workflow input. A repo that runs these evals already has a workflow
saying when to run them and with which credentials; putting the other half of
that decision in a file at the repo root means two places to read and two
places to disagree.

| Flag | Workflow input | Default | What it decides |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--skills-dir` | `skill_globs` | the directory you are in | Globs naming the directories that *are* skills, relative to the repo root. A skill is a directory with a `SKILL.md`, and its directory name is its identity. A repo that keeps its skills together passes `skills/*`. |
| `--routing-room` | `routing_room` | `--skill` if given, else the only skill, if there is one | The skills a routing run installs side by side. `all` means every skill with a dataset, `none` means no routing run, and blank means `--skill` is the room, a repo with one skill runs that skill, and a repo with several and no `--skill` has to choose. |
| `--infra-paths` | `infra_paths` | none | Paths that change the harness rather than one skill, so touching one re-runs every skill instead of guessing at the blast radius. Your own workflow file belongs here. |
| `--docs` | `doc_globs` | none | Markdown outside the skills whose references should be checked too: a README, a docs tree. The skills themselves are always checked. |
| `--exclude-url` | `excluded_urls` | none | Regexes matching URLs the external reference check leaves alone. For hosts that are auth-gated or that answer a runner's IP with a 403. |
| `--skill-files` | `skill_files` | none | Files every skill must ship beside its `SKILL.md`, such as a governance card. |
| `--skill-sections` | `skill_sections` | none | `##` headings each of those markdown files must have something under, such as `Description,Owner,License`. |
| `--behavior-runner` | `behavior_runner` | `["ubuntu-latest"]` | `runs-on` labels for a behavioral leg. |
| `--behavior-os` | `behavior_os` | `Linux` | Platforms a skill runs on when its `machine.yml` does not narrow them. |
| `--scoped-runner` | `scoped_runner` | reuses `behavior_runner` | Base labels for a leg whose skill asks for hardware labels. |
| `--scoped-gate` | `scoped_gate` | none | Pull-request label required before those legs run. |
| `--scoped-environment` | `scoped_environment` | none | GitHub environment holding their credentials. |

Beyond those, the graded commands take `--skill` and `--only` to narrow a run to
some skills or some case ids, `--no-extended` to skip a skill's optional
`extended_evals.json`, `--model` and `--effort` to choose what grades it,
`--output` and `--summary` to place the reports, and `--timeout` to bound the
whole command. Routing adds `--jobs`, `--case-timeout`, `--max-tool-calls`,
`--max-budget-usd`, `--keep-logs`, and `--min-accuracy`. `--help` is the
authority on all of them.

### Where the skills are

Every path in the table is relative to the repository root, which is the only
base a workflow input, a line of `git diff --name-only`, and a root-relative
markdown link can all agree on. `skills/*` in a workflow means the same thing
wherever its runner happens to have started.

The one thing measured from somewhere else is `--skills-dir` when you do not
pass it: then it is every directory in the one you ran the command from.
Standing in a tree of skills and typing `skillscope structural` can only mean
these ones, and a repo that keeps them a level down works with a `cd` rather
than a flag. Under CI the two bases coincide, because the action runs from
the repo root — so a run with no `--skills-dir` grades the directories at the
root, and a repo whose skills live anywhere else names them.

Either way it looks one level down and no further. Searching a whole tree for
every `SKILL.md` finds vendored copies, fixtures, and a contributor's local
install, and each of those silently changes a routing score.

### Who a skill competes against is listed, not inferred

`routing_room` is the one input with no useful default, because the answer is
what the score *means*. Install every skill on disk and a work-in-progress
directory drops everyone's number; install only the skill under review and it
wins every prompt by walkover. A skill you leave off the list still gets its
dataset checked and its behavioral cases run — it just does not move anybody's
routing score. Listing them also makes the change visible: a skill joining or
leaving the room moves every other skill's number, and that deserves a diff.

A repo with one skill has no such choice, so leave `routing_room` blank and
its only skill is the room. The score is then the half of the question that can
be answered alone — does the skill fire on its own prompts, and does it stay
quiet on its near misses and the shared negatives — and it stops meaning that
the moment a second skill shows up, at which point the flag becomes required
again rather than quietly picking a room for you. Naming skills with `--skill`
and leaving `--routing-room` off is still a listing, not a guess: those skills
are the room. The workflow input has no `--skill`, so a repo with several still
has to choose. To turn routing off instead, say so: `routing_room: none`.

## What the structural check asserts

The Agent Skills format is small — a folder, a `SKILL.md`, and a frontmatter
block naming the skill and saying when to use it — and every part of it fails
quietly. A `name` that disagrees with the folder makes the dataset, the routing
verdict, and the report about a skill that does not exist. A missing
`description` leaves an agent nothing to match a prompt against. Frontmatter
that is not valid YAML stops the file loading at all, and what you see is an
agent that simply never uses the skill. So every `SKILL.md` is read first:

| What | Bar |
| --- | --- |
| frontmatter | opens the file, is valid YAML, and is a mapping |
| `name` | non-empty, at most 64 characters, lowercase-with-hyphens, free of `anthropic` and `claude`, and equal to the folder name |
| `description` | non-empty, at most 1024 characters |
| body | at most 500 lines — past that it is reference material, and an agent reads it in full every time the skill loads |

A directory that holds no `SKILL.md` is simply not a skill, and is passed over
without a word. Matching *no* skill at all is the case that is reported, since
a run that graded nothing and called itself green is the one way this harness
can lie about a repo; a run given `--docs` is exempt, having been asked to
check a repo's own prose.

Whatever else your repo asks of a skill is policy rather than format, so it is
configuration:

```yaml
skill_files: skill-card.md
skill_sections: Description,Owner,License
```

No manifest is read. Which skills a repo publishes, and where it lists them, is
that repo's business — a harness with an opinion about it would be a second
place to update every time a skill ships.

## References

A skill is prose an agent reads and then acts on. A link to a reference file
that was renamed, or an anchor into a section that was retitled, is not
cosmetic: the agent follows it, finds nothing, and improvises. So the structural
check reads every markdown file under every skill — plus whatever `doc_globs`
names — and resolves what it finds.

| Check | What it reads | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| internal | relative paths, root-relative paths, and heading anchors, against the files on disk | always, and a paid run waits on it |
| external | every `http(s)` URL, fetched | only with `--external`, or the `external_references` job |

The split is by failure mode, not by effort. The internal half is deterministic
and offline, so it can gate a merge and a token spend without ever being wrong
for a reason of its own. The external half fetches other people's servers,
which fail for reasons that have nothing to do with the change under review: a
rate limit, a runner IP a host blocks, DNS having a bad minute. It runs as its
own job that the aggregate result ignores, so link rot is visible without a bad
minute somewhere else holding up a merge. Point a schedule at the workflow to
catch rot in markdown nobody is editing.

A 2xx answer is reachable, and so is a 429 — that is a host saying "you again",
which is a fact about the run rather than the link. `HEAD` is asked first and
asked again as a `GET` whenever it does not come back with one, since plenty of
hosts refuse the method or ignore it. Hosts are fetched from in parallel, one
request at a time each: a checker that opens twenty connections to the same
documentation site gets itself throttled, and a throttled request is
indistinguishable from link rot.

Links inside fenced code blocks, inline code spans, and HTML comments are left
alone — those are illustrations of links rather than promises.

## Routing, and the bar it is held to

`--min-accuracy` / `min_accuracy` defaults to `1`: every graded routing case has
to land on the right skill, the same way every behavioral expectation has to
hold. A routing miss is a defect and not a statistic — a description that fires
on its neighbour's prompt makes that neighbour worse — so it turns the run red
rather than sitting in a summary nobody reads.

Loosening it is a one-line diff. `0` reports the score without gating on it,
which is where a repo that has never measured its prompts should start; anything
in between holds a bar short of perfect. The bar is over the cases that were
*graded*: a case whose own run errored counts towards neither side of it,
because a timeout says nothing about routing. No value turns off the
infrastructure checks — a run where nothing was graded, or where no skill
activated anywhere, fails at any bar, since those numbers are an artifact
rather than a result.

Two failure modes are worth knowing before reading a report. A routing case that
ends without the agent either activating a skill or answering is reported as an
**error** rather than a missed trigger. And if the runner has its own skills
installed (usually `~/.claude/skills`), they join the room for every case and
the report says so — set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` so the run can use an isolated
config dir.

## Hardware a skill needs

A skill that cannot run on the everyday runners says so in
`evals/machine.yml`
([authoring-evals.md](authoring-evals.md#evalsmachineyml)). Those labels are
added to `scoped_runner`, and asking for any of them is what makes a leg
*scoped*: it lands on the pool your workflow rations with `scoped_gate` and
pays for out of `scoped_environment`. The split is deliberate. The person who
knows a skill needs a GPU is its owner; the person who knows which pool has
one, who may spend it, and whose key pays for it is whoever runs the repo. A
central table mapping skills to runners drifts from reality the first time a
skill is added.

Legs with a scoped environment run as a separate job, because a job's
credentials are fixed before its matrix expands. A repo that declares no scoped
environment gets one matrix, labels and all.

## Which engine grades a run

`--engine` chooses what actually runs the cases. The dataset, the CLI and the
reports are identical whichever you pick; only the thing driving the agent
changes.

| `--engine` | What runs | Runs in | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `legacy` (default) | The `claude` CLI, driven directly | the host | the CLI on `PATH` |
| `claude-code` | The real CLI, via `inspect_swe` | a sandbox | `skillscope[verify]`, Linux only |
| `claude-cli` | The real CLI, under `inspect_ai` | the host | `skillscope[inspect]`, the CLI on `PATH` |

All three drive the agent a skill is written for, so what differs between them
is **where the agent runs**, not what it is. That is the axis worth choosing
along: the host measures the machine as it is, with whatever else is installed
on it, and the sandbox measures the skill alone. When the two disagree, the
disagreement is usually a fact about one of those environments rather than
about the skill -- which is a thing one engine on its own cannot tell you.

`claude-code` is a reporting leg, never a gate. Harness runs are
nondeterministic and the harness is not what is being graded, so a divergence
there is a question about the skill rather than a build failure.

**Routing runs on `legacy` only.** The other two reach the CLI through
`inspect_ai`, and the routing leg has no path that does; asking for either is
refused rather than quietly run as `legacy`. So routing is always unsandboxed
today, and its reports say so.

### Where a sandboxed run is sandboxed

Two separate decisions, made by different people.

**Which provider** is a property of the runner, chosen with
`SKILLSCOPE_SANDBOX`. Docker by default; `podman` on a host that has that
instead; `local` to skip the container. `local` is for working locally rather
than for CI, because a graded run that quietly dropped its sandbox would report
the same numbers with none of the isolation.

Podman needs three things, and each was discovered by the next one failing:

* `pip install 'skillscope[podman]'`. The provider is registered by a separate
  package through an entry point, so the podman binary alone is not enough.
* `podman-compose`, and `INSPECT_PODMAN_COMPOSE=podman-compose`. Bare
  `podman compose` is a shim that delegates to whichever compose provider it
  finds, which on a host that also has Docker is Docker's -- and that then
  talks to a daemon podman was chosen to avoid.
* A search registry, because podman will not guess one. Docker assumes Docker
  Hub for an image name with no registry; podman refuses, and the default
  sandbox image is named without one. `unqualified-search-registries =
  ["docker.io"]` in `/etc/containers/registries.conf`.

Podman is worth the setup where the runner's user cannot reach the Docker
socket, since it is daemonless and rootless and needs neither that nor group
membership.

**What the sandbox must provide** is a property of the skill, declared as
`sandbox: compose.yaml` in its `evals/machine.yml`, resolved beside it. Skills get a container with
no network by default; one that installs a server or pulls a model cannot run
that way and says so. Selecting a provider does not discard what a skill asked
for -- the compose file rides along.

[`examples/skill-with-a-device/evals/`](../examples/skill-with-a-device/evals)
is the pair, worked through: a `machine.yml` that asks for GPU runners and
names a compose file, and the compose file that binds the devices in and
grants egress. The two are not substitutes. `labels:` decides which machine the
job lands on; `sandbox:` decides whether the container on it can see the
hardware that machine has. A skill that sets only the first gets the right
runner and a container that cannot reach its device.

Windows is the exception to both: inspect's sandbox layer and every tool built
on it assume a POSIX guest, so those legs run unsandboxed and trade isolation
for running on the platform they are meant to test.

To see what changing engine would do to your own datasets before changing it,
[`tools/benchmark_engines.py`](../tools/benchmark_engines.py) runs the same
cases through two engines and reports per-case agreement, measured against how
much one engine already disagrees with itself.

## In CI: one job

[`reusable.yml`](../.github/workflows/reusable.yml) grades a repo's skills with
one runner per skill:

```yaml
jobs:
  evals:
    uses: amd/skillscope/.github/workflows/reusable.yml@v0.1.3
    secrets:
      api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    with:
      skills: path/to/my-skill
```

Map your model key onto `api_key`; this workflow never sees the rest of the
vault, and never learns what you named the secret. `secrets: inherit` still
works if you would rather pass the vault and name the key with
`api_key_secret`.

All three graders run, all three can fail the run, and every skill named gets a
runner of its own: the structural checks first, then a routing leg and a
behavioral leg per skill, all at once. Ten skills is twenty paid legs running in
parallel, each with its own check and its own report.

Naming several, and holding them to different bars:

```yaml
    with:
      skills: |
        path/to/my-skill
        path/to/another-skill
      routing: optional     # graded and reported, but cannot fail the run
      behavioral: off       # not run at all
```

| Input | Default | What it decides |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `skills` | `./*` | The skills to grade: a directory, or a glob matching several, one per line or comma-separated. The default is every directory at the repo root. |
| `structural` | `required` | `required`, `optional`, or `off`. |
| `routing` | `required` | `required`, `optional`, or `off`. |
| `behavioral` | `required` | `required`, `optional`, or `off`. |
| `runner` | `ubuntu-latest` | `runs-on` for every job: one label, or a JSON array of them. |
| `min_accuracy` | `1` | The routing bar. `0` reports the score without gating on it. |
| `api_key` | (none) | The model API key, mapped from the caller's vault. One secret, not the whole set. |
| `api_key_secret` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Name to look up under `secrets: inherit`, if you would rather pass the vault than map one key. |

`optional` is for a bar you have not met yet: the leg runs, the report lands in
the step summary, and a red leg leaves the run green. `off` does not run it at
all. Both are one-word diffs a reviewer can see, which is the point — a step
nobody can see being dropped is a step nobody notices is gone.

Each routing leg here installs one skill, which answers the half of the routing
question a skill can be asked alone. For the other half — whether a skill
answers a prompt that belongs to its neighbour — the neighbour has to be in the
room, and that is the pipeline below.

[`examples/amd-skills-checks.yml`](../examples/amd-skills-checks.yml) is a
caller with its triggers filled in.

## In CI: the full pipeline

[`skill-evals.yml`](../.github/workflows/skill-evals.yml) is the same three
graders with three more decisions on top: routing pools the listed skills'
datasets into one run, so each skill's prompts are the others' negatives; a pull
request grades only what it changed; and a skill that asks for particular
hardware in its `evals/machine.yml` lands on the pool your workflow rations and
pays for.

```yaml
jobs:
  skill-evals:
    uses: amd/skillscope/.github/workflows/skill-evals.yml@v0.1.3
    secrets: inherit
    with:
      routing_room: my-skill,its-neighbour
      api_key_secret: MY_MODEL_API_KEY
```

Reach for it when skills in the repo could plausibly be confused for one
another, or when a behavioral run needs a GPU. Its inputs are the table in
[Configuring the repo under test](#configuring-the-repo-under-test), and the
workflow file documents every one.

### Authenticating without a key

`skill-evals.yml` can authenticate by [workload identity
federation](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/workload-identity-federation)
instead of holding a model key: name a rule and each graded job trades its own
GitHub OIDC token for a short-lived Anthropic one.

```yaml
jobs:
  skill-evals:
    permissions:
      contents: read
      # Required, and only grantable here: a called workflow can only lower
      # what its caller passed down.
      id-token: write
    uses: amd/skillscope/.github/workflows/skill-evals.yml@v0.1.3
    with:
      api_key_secret: ""
      federation_rule_id: fdrl_...
      federation_organization_id: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
      federation_service_account_id: svac_...
      federation_workspace_id: wrkspc_...   # only if the rule spans workspaces
```

To run a single command instead of a pipeline, use the action directly:

```yaml
- uses: amd/skillscope@v0.1.3
  with:
    command: structural
```

Deciding what to run by hand is also possible: `select` emits the plan for a
change as JSON.

```bash
skillscope select --since main HEAD
```

`--since` takes the two commits a pull request names and works the changed
paths out from their merge base, so a branch is planned for what it changed
rather than for how it differs from a base that has moved on without it.
Without that, everything merged into the base since the branch left it comes
back in the diff, and a base commit touching an [infra
path](#configuring-the-repo-under-test) re-runs the whole catalog.

Pass a list of paths instead when it was worked out some other way:

```bash
git diff --name-only main...HEAD | skillscope select --changed
```

## Versions

The `uses:` ref is the harness. Pin the reusable workflow (or the action) at
the tag you want to run:

```yaml
jobs:
  evals:
    uses: amd/skillscope/.github/workflows/reusable.yml@v0.1.3
```

That tag's checkout is what grades your skills. Bump the ref in that one line
when you want a newer harness. There is no separate `version` input and no pin
inside `evals.json`.

`v0.1.1` is the first tag where this holds. At `v0.1.0` every job inside the
reusable workflow said `uses: amd/skillscope@main`, so pinning that tag ran
whatever `main` happened to be that morning.

## Hand tools

`tools/` holds tools that are no part of the graded pipeline:
`claude_eval.py` (what did this one prompt cost?), `compare_skill.py` (the same
prompt with and without a skill, side by side), and
`verify_selection_parity.py` (does `select` still plan what `amd/skills` planned
before the harness moved out of it?).
