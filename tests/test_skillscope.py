"""Tests for the harness itself. No agent, no tokens, no network.

    python -m unittest discover -s tests -t .

Three jobs. First, guard the parts that decide whether a paid run is
trustworthy: routing verdicts, activation detection, and the rules that reject
a malformed dataset. Second, keep the JSON Schema in lockstep with the parser
-- the schema is the field reference skill owners read, and one that has
quietly drifted from what the runner enforces is worse than no schema at all.
Third, hold the harness to being repo-agnostic, which is the whole reason it
lives in its own repo: every test that needs a repo builds a throwaway one in a
temp directory rather than reading whatever happens to be checked out here.
