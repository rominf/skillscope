"""Per-skill eval datasets: discovery, parsing, and structural checks.

Every skill owns one dataset at ``<skill>/evals/evals.json``, holding an
``evaluations`` array. Each evaluation is a user prompt, a yes/no answer to
"should this skill fire?", and -- when the answer is yes -- what should be
true once it has::

    {
      "id": "epyc-vllm-zentorch",
      "skill_should_trigger": true,
      "prompt": "Serve Llama 3.1 8B with zentorch."
    }

A skill may ship a second dataset in the same format at
``<skill>/evals/extended_evals.json``. It is optional, it carries no coverage
requirement of its own -- the tier-0 bar below is counted over ``evals.json``
alone -- and whether it runs at all is the caller's decision
(``extended=True`` here, ``--extended`` on the runner). It is where a product
repo keeps the prompts it wants graded in its own CI without every consumer of
its skills paying for them.

There are two graded commands to satisfy:

  * **routing** -- the skills a workflow lists are installed side by side and
    only the trigger decision is graded ("did the right skill fire, and only
    then?"). Every evaluation of a listed skill runs here.
  * **behavioral** -- just this skill is installed, the run goes to completion,
    and ``expected_behavior`` / ``unexpected_behavior`` / ``logs_contain`` /
    ``files_exist`` are graded ("once it fired, did it do the job?"). Only a
    triggering evaluation can run here, and only if it asserts something.

One prompt graded by both is the point: a routing prompt that nothing grades
is a prompt nobody maintains, and a behavioral test that re-asserts routing
with a substring match is a worse version of a check this module already
models as a field.

``skill_should_trigger: false`` makes the evaluation routing-only. No skill
loads for it, so there is no behavioral phase to hang an assertion or a staged
workspace off, and those fields are rejected rather than silently ignored:
such an evaluation is an ``id``, a ``prompt``, the flag, and maybe a ``note``.

The folder is the identity, so no evaluation names a skill;
``serving-llms-on-epyc/evals/evals.json`` is about ``serving-llms-on-epyc``
and ``skill_should_trigger`` refers to it. A prompt that should trigger a
*different* skill belongs in that skill's dataset: routing installs those
skills side by side, so it is the same assertion either way, and filing it
under the neighbour keeps ``false`` meaning "nothing fires".

Prompt categories are derived rather than declared, because the flag and the
file a prompt lives in already carry the distinction:

  * ``skill_should_trigger: true``               -> ``positive``
  * ``false`` in a skill's own dataset           -> ``near_miss`` (its owner
    wrote it precisely because it sits close to that skill)
  * an evaluation in the shared pool             -> ``unrelated`` (belongs to
    no skill's domain)

Stdlib only, so a run needs no wheels beyond this package. ``machine_plan`` is
the one exception and imports PyYAML lazily; nothing on the run path calls it.

    need (``sandbox``, read by ``--engine claude-code``)::

        os: [Linux]
        labels: [mi300x]
        sandbox: compose.yaml

    ``sandbox`` is how a skill that must reach the network to pull a model, or
    that needs a device bound in, opts out of the default no-network container
    instead of every skill paying for what one of them needs.

    Labels rather than a class name, because a class name has to be defined
    somewhere and that somewhere is a second file to keep in step. A label is
    the thing GitHub actually matches a runner on, so a skill saying `mi300x`
    says everything: it lands on a pool carrying that label, and if no pool
    does, that is visible as a queued job rather than hidden behind a mapping
    that quietly resolved to nothing.

    What follows from asking for hardware -- which base labels to start from,
    which pull-request label rations the pool, which environment holds its
    credentials -- is the repo's business and comes from the workflow, not from
    here. Returns ``{os, labels}``, raising SystemExit on a malformed file so
    CI stops at planning.
