"""The one entry point for skill evals.

Every skill owns a single dataset at ``<skill>/evals/evals.json``. This runner
reads those datasets and grades them with three commands:

  * ``structural`` -- every skill folder, every dataset, and every reference
    the skill's markdown makes. No agent, no tokens, instant.
  * ``routing`` -- installs the skills named by ``--routing-room`` side by
    side and checks that the right one fires (and that nothing fires when
    nothing should). Cheap, no hardware, and it pools those skills' prompts so
    each one's positives are the others' negatives. A repo with a single skill
    need not name it: there is only one room its skill can be in.
  * ``behavioral`` -- installs one skill, runs the prompt to completion, and
    grades ``expected_behavior`` / ``unexpected_behavior`` / ``logs_contain``
    / ``files_exist``. Only runs evaluations that assert something beyond the
    routing decision.

A skill may also ship ``<skill>/evals/extended_evals.json``, in the same format
and under no coverage requirement of its own. Both graded commands include it
by default; ``--no-extended`` grades the required dataset alone.

The prompt is written once and both graded commands read it, which is the whole
point: the alternative is a central routing prompt set plus a separate
per-skill test file that re-asserts routing with a substring match on the
transcript.

Usage::

    # structural checks only: no agent, no tokens, instant
    skillscope structural

    # the same, plus fetching every external URL the skills link to
    skillscope structural --external

    # what a skill does once it has fired
    skillscope behavioral --skill serving-llms-on-epyc

    # what CI runs: a routing miss fails the run, like a behavioral miss does
    skillscope routing --routing-room local-ai-use,tracelens --no-extended
    skillscope behavioral --skill local-ai-use --no-extended

    # a routing run that reports its score instead of gating on it
    skillscope routing --routing-room all --min-accuracy 0

    # a repo with one skill: the room is that skill, so nothing names it
    skillscope routing

    # one case, keeping the raw transcript
    skillscope routing --only qwen-on-mi300x --keep-logs eval-logs

    # what CI should run for a change
    skillscope select --since BASE HEAD

    # the same, from a list of paths worked out some other way
    git diff --name-only BASE...HEAD | skillscope select --changed

Reports go to stdout as markdown, to ``$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`` under Actions,
and to a JSON artifact under ``.skillscope/runs/`` in the repo under test.

    Built twice for a subcommand that takes ``--routing-room``, because two
    of the answers that flag accepts -- ``all``, and the single skill a repo
    with one of them never had to name -- are questions about which skills
    ship a dataset, and that is itself answered through the config. The first
    pass is what makes the repo readable, the second records the answer.

    A blank room with ``--skill`` set is filled from ``--skill`` before that
    second pass: naming the skills to grade also names who they sit with,
    and an explicit ``--routing-room`` still wins.
