"""Grading for the engines built on `inspect_ai`.

One scorer grades every expectation a case carries and reports them all, rather
than one scorer per kind. A behavioral run costs minutes and real tokens, so a
run that fails should not have to be repeated to discover the second thing wrong
with it -- the same reason the legacy `Run.evaluate` reports instead of raising.

The per-expectation results ride in `Score.metadata["checks"]` in the shape
`agent.Check` uses, so `behavior.render_markdown` keeps working unchanged.
