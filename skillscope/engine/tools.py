"""A tool set that works on a non-POSIX guest.

inspect's own tools assume one: `bash()` execs `["bash", "--login", "-c", ...]`,
`text_editor()` needs a Linux-only helper binary, and `list_files()`/`grep()`
shell out to `find`/`grep`. On a Windows host with the `local` sandbox that
leaves an agent that can read and think but cannot write a file or run a
command -- not enough to grade a behavioral case with.

Everything here is built on `SandboxEnvironment.exec` / `read_file` /
`write_file`, which are provider-level and platform-neutral. Only the shell
invocation differs, and that is probed once per sample rather than assumed:
the same Docker sandbox is POSIX whichever host started it, so the host's own
platform is not the answer.
