"""Which sandbox a skill's cases run in.

Two decisions, kept apart because they are made by different people.

**Which provider** is a property of the machine: Docker by default, `podman` on
a host that has that instead, `local` where there is no container at all.
`SKILLSCOPE_SANDBOX` selects it, because whoever runs the job knows what the
runner has and a skill does not. Any provider inspect can resolve works --
`podman` comes from `inspect-podman`, which registers itself through an
`inspect_ai` entry point, so installing it is the whole setup.

**What the sandbox has to provide** is a property of the skill, declared in
`evals/machine.yml` with a `sandbox:` key naming a compose file. A skill that
must reach the network to pull a model, or that needs a device bound in, says
so there instead of every skill paying for what one of them needs.

Windows is the exception to both: inspect's sandbox layer, and every tool built
on it, assumes a POSIX guest, so the Windows legs run `local` and trade
isolation for running on the platform they are meant to test. Ephemeral,
off-network runners are what covers that gap.
