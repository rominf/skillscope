"""The LLM judge for `expected_behavior` / `unexpected_behavior`.

Two properties of the legacy judge are load-bearing and preserved here.

**Polarity is never inverted.** The judge is shown the requirement as written,
including "must not" ones, and reports whether the requirement is *satisfied*.
A caller that negates the verdict turns a correct run into a failure, which is
why `agent._grade_with_llm` carries the same warning.

**The judge sees what the agent produced, not what it said about it.** Evidence
is the tool calls, the tool output, and the artifacts themselves -- an agent
writing "I won't call the cloud API" must not satisfy an expectation that it
avoided doing so, and must not fail one either. Text artifacts are included
inline and images are attached, so "did it actually generate a picture of a
cat" is answerable rather than inferred from a filename.
