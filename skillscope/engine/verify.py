"""The Claude Code verification leg (`--engine claude-code`).

The `inspect` engine grades a skill with a harness-independent agent, which is
a deliberate choice: it tests whether a skill's *instructions* work rather than
how one product reads them. This leg exists to answer the question that choice
raises -- do the results still hold under the real thing?

It runs actual Claude Code inside the sandbox, via `inspect_swe`, and produces
the same outcome objects as the other two engines, so the benchmark tool can
diff its report against theirs with nothing new.

**Reporting only.** It is not a gate. Harness runs are nondeterministic and the
harness is not what we are grading; a divergence here is a question about the
skill, not a build failure.

**Linux only.** `inspect_swe` shells `bash -c` merely to locate the CLI, and the
model proxy it starts in the guest is a Linux binary, so a Windows guest cannot
run this leg at all. That is the whole reason the primary engine does not depend
on it.
