"""Routing engine: does the right skill fire, and only then?

Behavioral asks "once this skill runs, does it do the job?". This asks the
question that comes first: **given several skills installed side by side, does
the agent pick the right one?** It grades the routing decision only, so it
catches the four failure modes a description can cause:

  * correct trigger -- the expected skill activated.
  * missed trigger  -- a skill was expected and none activated (under-triggering).
  * wrong skill     -- a skill activated, but not the expected one (two
                       descriptions overlap and the agent picked the wrong side).
  * false trigger   -- no skill was expected and one activated (over-triggering).

Which skills are in the room is the workflow's decision, passed in as
``--routing-room``. Wherever there is a choice it has to be a decision
someone makes deliberately, because that set is what the number means: a skill
tested alongside two neighbours is answering a harder question than one tested
alongside none. A repo with a single skill has no choice to make and so makes
none; it still gets the over- and under-triggering half of the answer, graded
against its own near misses and the shared negatives. Cases are pooled across
the room's datasets, so a positive case for skill Y is automatically a negative
for skill X and the confusion matrix fills itself in.

Cost control: each run is killed the moment the routing decision is observable
-- the first skill activation, the final result event, or a small budget of
tool calls that are neither bookkeeping nor a survey of the installed skills
-- so no case pays for the work the skill would have gone on to do.
``max_budget_usd`` is a second, independent backstop.

The CLI lives in ``skillscope/cli.py``; this module is the engine.
